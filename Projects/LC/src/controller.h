/**

 * @brief Definition of the game state machine and the controller in this MVC architecture.
 * @details The controller is responsible for handling the input of the user via the keyboard and mouse, the output via the video card, the timer and the communication with the other player via the serial port. The game state machine is responsible for managing the game state and the transitions between them.
