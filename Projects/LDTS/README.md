## LDTS_02_08 - Chess


![gif](docs/gameplay.gif)


A recreation of the popular game of chess in a terminal interface.  
Two local players play against each other by moving different pieces in a board with the objective of capturing the opponent's king.
Each piece has a different behaviour and can only move in a certain way, but pawns can be upgraded to other pieces if they reach the other side of the board.
This game requires a strategic mindset, but also speed, because each player has a limited amount of time to make their move.

> [!NOTE]
> This project will try to recreate a game of chess, including all of its rules and mechanics.
